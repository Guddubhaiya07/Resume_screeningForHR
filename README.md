# Resume Screening with Python

## Overview
This project involves the application of machine learning techniques for the screening of resumes. The goal is to categorize resumes into different job categories using natural language processing and classification algorithms.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following libraries installed:
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK
- Wordcloud

You can install them using the following command:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn nltk wordcloud
```

## Data
The dataset (`UpdatedResumeDataSet.csv`) contains resumes along with their respective categories. The project involves cleaning the resume text, visualizing the data distribution, and applying machine learning algorithms for classification.

## Project Structure
- `resume screening.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, visualization, and machine learning model training.
- `output_0 to 10.csv`: Dataset file containing resumes and categories.

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/raghavendranhp/Resume_screening.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute code cells and explore the project.

## Results
The project achieves [mention accuracy or any other relevant metrics] on the test set. The model has been trained using [algorithm] and exhibits robust performance in categorizing resumes.
